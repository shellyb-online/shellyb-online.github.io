            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <div class="div2">
                I'm a dedicated backend developer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable, and secure
                applications. With a strong background in technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I thrive
                on building robust APIs and managing databases that power seamless user experiences. <br><br> My
                journey in tech began with a fascination for problem-solving and a desire to understand how things
                work behind the scenes. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions, always
                prioritizing clean and maintainable code. <br><br> I believe that collaboration is key to successful
                development. Working closely with cross-functional teams, I strive to bridge the gap between backend
                functionality and frontend needs, ensuring a cohesive product experience. <br><br>When I'm not
                coding, I love exploring new frameworks and tools, contributing to open-source projects, and staying
                updated on industry trends. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am eager to
                continue growing as a developer. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
